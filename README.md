#CxqWeb-Source
##A quizzing system
CxqWeb-Source is designed to create and display HTML quizzes in CGI based on an ini-style quiz file. It then takes the student's responses, and puts them into an answer file which can either be used to grade by hand, or passed to another program (Cxq-Source or similar) to actually grade the quizzes.
