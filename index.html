		<h1>Welcome to the CxqWeb-Source portal page!</h1>
		<h2>Why are you here?</h2>
		<p>
			This page is built to look confusing. There is no content here, in fact this page should never be linked for any purpose. If you came here by mistake, I'm sorry you had to read this far to realize that.
		</p>
		<h2>Why is this page unstyled and unfinished?</h2>
		<p>
			This interface is built so that professors can send their students a link to an online quiz and the students can take that quiz. It is not, however, built to list the available quizzes, or be easy to use assuming you don't have the right code. If you figure it out for yourself, kudos, you've certainly earned it! If not, however, it is probably because you're not supposed to be in that place, and should therefore return to wherever you came from.
